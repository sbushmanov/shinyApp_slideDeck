## Why stocks and bonds?

- Stocks and Bonds are two distinct asset classes that usually form a significant part of any long-term investment portfolio

- Asset allocation between Stocks and Bonds is a cumbersome process (sometimes referred to as "investment art"), which among others relies on the following characteristics of the assets classes:

*** {name: left}
### Bonds 

- lower risks
- lower rewards

*** {name: right}
### Stocks  

- higher risks (measured by return volatility)
- higher reward (measured by average long-term returns)

## Stocks vs Bonds: historical volatility

```{r}
load("./returnData.RData")
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data=subset(returnData, year %in% 2000:2009), x=year, y=return, 
      color=variable, geom="line") + labs(title = "Value of $1 invested in 2000 through 2009")
```
