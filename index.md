## Why stocks and bonds?

- Stocks and Bonds are two distinct asset classes that usually form a significant part of any long-term investment portfolio

- Asset allocation between Stocks and Bonds is a cumbersome process (sometimes referred to as "investment art"), which among others relies on the following characteristics of the assets classes:

*** {name: left}
### Bonds 

- lower risks
- lower rewards

*** {name: right}
### Stocks  

- higher risks (measured by return volatility)
- higher reward (measured by average long-term returns)
